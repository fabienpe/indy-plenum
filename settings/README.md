Many of the contributors use PyCharm. Since we deviate from the PEP8 naming
convention, but we still want to benefit from code inspection, we've included

files can go here as well.

### Using dictionaries
For PyCharm to not flag project-specific words as typos, add the dictionary.xml 
file to ~/.idea/dictionaries/ folder.
